
Volcano Animations
Interactive Volcano Visualization
This page provides scientifically accurate animations of different volcano types and eruption processes. The visualizations combine real InSAR data with computational models to help understand volcanic activity patterns.

Explore Different Types of Visualizations:
Surface Deformation Patterns - View InSAR-like visualizations showing ground movement
Magma Chamber Dynamics - Explore the behavior of magma within the volcano
Eruption Sequence - See how key metrics change throughout a volcanic eruption
Real InSAR Data - Compare with actual satellite radar interferometry data
The animations are based on scientific models and real-world volcano behavior patterns.

Surface Deformation Patterns
This visualization shows simulated InSAR interferometry patterns for different volcano types.

In InSAR data:

Each complete color cycle (fringe) represents ~2.8 cm of ground displacement
Concentric patterns often indicate inflation or deflation of a magma reservoir
The pattern shape reveals information about the magma chamber's depth and geometry
Choose a volcano to see its characteristic deformation pattern based on its type and alert level.

Select a volcano:

Anak Krakatau
Selected Volcano: Anak Krakatau

Type: Stratovolcano

Alert Level: Watch

InSAR-like Interferogram
3D Surface Deformation
How to interpret:

The 3D plot shows the actual ground displacement (unwrapped)
Upward movement (inflation) appears as peaks
Downward movement (deflation) appears as depressions
The pattern shape is related to the magma chamber's characteristics
