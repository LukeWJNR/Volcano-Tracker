    ## Climate Change & Volcanic Activity
    
    This page presents detailed information about glaciated volcanoes around the world that may be affected by climate change.
    The melting of glaciers that cover these volcanoes can lead to:
    
    - Reduced confining pressure on magma chambers
    - Increased chances of explosive eruptions
    - Higher risk of lahars (volcanic mudflows)
    - Changes in hydrothermal systems
    
    The interactive cards below show risk assessments for each volcano, including:
    
    - Alert level and eruption type
    - Deformation rate measurements (mm/year)
    - SOâ‚‚ emission levels where available
    - Links to InSAR imagery for further analysis

    ## Sources & Methodology
    
    Data for this visualization is sourced from:
    
    - Global Volcanism Program (GVP) database
    - InSAR satellite monitoring networks
    - Published research on climate-volcano interactions
    - Volcanic observatories worldwide
    
    Risk assessments are based on:
    
    - Historical eruption patterns
    - Current monitoring data
    - Glacier coverage and recent changes
    - Proximity to population centers
