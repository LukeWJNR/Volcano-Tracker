        ### AI in Volcano Monitoring
        
        The frontier of volcanology now includes artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect patterns 
        in seismic, geodetic, and geochemical data that human analysis might miss. As demonstrated in recent 
        Mayotte research, these approaches can identify subtle precursors to eruptions and potentially 
        improve early warning systems, especially for submarine volcanoes where direct observation is limited.
